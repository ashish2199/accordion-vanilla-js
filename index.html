      Accordions are useful when you want to toggle between hiding and showing
      large amount of content.

          I have to maintain a large number of classic ASP pages, many of which
          have tabular data with no sort capabilities at all. Whatever order the
          original developer used in the database query is what you're stuck
          with. I want to to tack on some basic sorting to a bunch of these
          pages, and I'm doing it all client side with javascript. I already
          have the basic script done to sort a given table on a given column in
          a given direction, and it works well as long as the table is limited
          by certain conventions we follow here. What I want to do for the UI is
          just indicate sort direction with the caret character ( ^ ) and ...
          what? Is there a special character that is the direct opposite of a
          caret? The letter v won't quite cut it. Alternatively, is there
          another character pairing I can use?
